### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a part of my code on https://git.kiefte.eu/LaPingvino/ instead. Check it out!

### Languages

- **Programming:** Go, various Lisp dialects, a good bunch of shell scripting, a good degree of HTML/CSS/JS/PHP (but I'm horrible at designing an interface...)
- **Spoken:** Dutch, Esperanto, English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Ido, Toki Pona, Italian and Afrikaans
